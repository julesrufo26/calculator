In this project, I created a calculator with the basic operations. 
It can do both floating point and integers.
Has clear and backspace in case you want to erase.
Maximum answer length is 16. It will show "Answer too long" if it's more than that.
Divide by zero will throw a syntax error message.
Will add keyboard support. :)
